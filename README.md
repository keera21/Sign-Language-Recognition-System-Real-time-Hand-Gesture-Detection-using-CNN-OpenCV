Built a real-time Sign Language Detector using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and OpenCV, enabling live recognition of American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet letters from webcam input.

The model was trained on the Sign Language MNIST dataset, consisting of grayscale images representing ASL gestures (Aâ€“Y, excluding J and Z). The project enables recognition and display of alphabet letters from live video feed using TensorFlow and OpenCV, with a defined region of interest (ROI) to focus prediction.

Key Features:

ðŸ“· Real-time webcam integration with live prediction overlay

ðŸ§  Trained a CNN on over 27,000 labeled ASL hand gestures

ðŸŽ¯ Achieved over 90% accuracy on test data

ðŸ“¦ Saved model and label encoder for deployment

ðŸŸ¨ ROI box for precise gesture detection and better results# Sign-Language-Recognition-System-Real-time-Hand-Gesture-Detection-using-CNN-OpenCV
